##Chapter 1. The Basics

###Answers

1. In the Scala REPL, type `3.` followed by the Tab key. What methods can be applied?     
**Answer**:

    * `%`
    * `&`
    * `*`
    * `+`
    * `-`
    * `/`
    * `>`
    * `>=`
    * `>>`
    * `>>>`
    * `^`
    * `asInstanceOf`
    * `isInstanceOf`
    * `toByte`
    * `toChar`
    * `toDouble`
    * `toFloat`
    * `toInt`
    * `toLong`
    * `toShort`
    * `toString`
    * `unary_+`
    * `unary_-`
    * `unary_~`
    * `|`


2. In the Scala REPL, compute the square root of 3, and then square that value. By how much does the result differ from 3? (Hint: The `res` variables are your friend.)     
**Answer**:

        scala> import scala.math._
        import scala.math._
        
        scala> sqrt(3)
        res0: Double = 1.7320508075688772
        
        scala> pow(res0, 2)
        res1: Double = 2.9999999999999996
        
        scala> 3 - res1
        res2: Double = 4.440892098500626E-16


3. Are the `res` variables `val` or `var`?     
**Answer**: `res` is `val` because --

        scala> 77*88
        res0: Int = 6776
        
        scala> res0 = 999
        <console>:8: error: reassignment to val
               res0 = 999
                    ^


4. Scala lets you multiply a string with a numberâ€”try out `"crazy" * 3` in the REPL. What does this operation do? Where can you find it in Scaladoc?     
**Answer**: It repeats the string for given times. e.g.

        scala> "crazy" * 3
        res1: String = crazycrazycrazy
        
    `def *(n: Int): String` on [StringLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.immutable.StringLike)


5. What does `10 max 2` mean? In which class is the max method defined?

6. Using `BigInt`, compute 2^1024.

7. What do you need to import so that you can get a random prime as `probablePrime(100, Random)`, without any qualifiers before `probablePrime` and `Random`?

8. One way to create random file or directory names is to produce a random `BigInt` and convert it to base 36, yielding a string such as `"qsnvbevtomcj38o06kul"`. Poke around Scaladoc to find a way of doing this in Scala.

9. How do you get the first character of a string in Scala? The last character?

10. What do the `take`, `drop`, `takeRight`, and `dropRight` string functions do? What advantage or disadvantage do they have over using `substring`?
